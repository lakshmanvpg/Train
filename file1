this is line from the lian branch
  In the small town of Aaryapur, there was a long white line painted down the center of an old playground.
No one really knew who drew it or why — but every child in the town had a story about it.

Some said it was drawn by the first school teacher(reddy) to divide the ground for games.
Others whispered that it was the boundary between bravery and fear, drawn by a soldier before leaving for war12.
